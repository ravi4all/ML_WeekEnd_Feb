Simulate tossing a fair coin 20 times, count the number of "heads".
As in the last exercise, simulate tossing a fair coin 20 times, do the same simulation 1,000 times. Count the number of "heads" for each simulation (save them in an array counts). Report and give an interpretation of the descriptive statistics of counts. Print the distribution of counts
